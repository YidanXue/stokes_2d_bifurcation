Repository for the manuscript "Stokes flows in a two-dimensional bifurcation" by Yidan Xue, Stephen J. Payne and Sarah L. Waters. The arXiv preprint can be found at https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11230.

Prerequisites
----------------------

The codes need to be run in MATLAB or Octave, its free alternative. The recommended version is MATLAB_R2023b. The user needs to have aaa.m in the same folder (or add it in the default MATLAB path) for the AAA rational approximation. The easist way to do this is to download Chebfun at https://www.chebfun.org.
